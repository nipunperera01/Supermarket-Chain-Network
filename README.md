# 🛒 Supermarket Chain Network Design & Security Implementation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates a **secure, scalable network infrastructure** for a multi-branch supermarket chain. It includes core routing, switching, VLAN segmentation, dynamic IP assignment, and security controls — all implemented and tested in a simulated environment.

> 🔧 Built and tested using **Cisco Packet Tracer**

---

## 🧠 Key Objectives
- Design a structured enterprise network topology for head office and multiple branch outlets.
- Implement Layer 2 and Layer 3 protocols to ensure efficient and redundant communication.
- Enhance network security using VLANs, firewalls, and proper segmentation.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Protocols Used

| Category | Tools / Protocols |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Routing** | OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) |
| **Switching** | LACP (Link Aggregation), STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) |
| **Segmentation** | VLANs for departments (e.g., Sales, Admin, HR) |
| **IP Management** | DHCP for dynamic IP assignment |
| **Security** | Basic Firewall Rules, Inter-VLAN ACLs |
| **Simulation Tool** | Cisco Packet Tracer |

## 🏢 Network Design Highlights

- 🏢 **Head Office**: Central router and Layer 3 switch setup with OSPF routing  
- 🏬 **Branches**: Small, Standard, and Mega outlet types with custom VLANs  
- 🌐 **Connectivity**: OSPF used for dynamic routing between branches  
- 🔁 **Redundancy**: STP and LACP used to prevent loops and improve link availability  
- 🔐 **Security**: Firewall rules and VLAN ACLs restrict inter-department traffic

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

- Real-world understanding of enterprise-level network design  
- Hands-on experience with dynamic routing and link redundancy  
- Security best practices using VLANs and ACLs  
- Documentation and logical planning of large-scale networks
